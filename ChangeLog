Changes since release 1.1:
  T.S: 2005/12/14:
  - cexpSystemModule must be checked for NULL (compiled with cexp support
    but cexp not used).
  T.S: 2005/12/13:
  - fixed typo in i386 variant (must be rtems_gdb_tgt_dump_frame() )
Changes since release 1.0:
  T.S: 2005/12/1:
  - added arch specific routines to dump register/stack contents
    when a thread crashes.
  - removed 'obsolete i/o'.
  - bugfix: when re-attaching to a dead task, list corruption had
    occurred (eventual assertion failure). E.g., if thread 3 ran
    into a segmentation violation then a 't 3, cont, Ctrl-C, t 3'
    sequence would trigger the behavior).
  - a few documentation fixes.
  - updated GDB patches; added patch for gdb-6.3.
  T.S: 2005/11/13:
  - silenced compiler warnings by explicitely casting signed/unsigned
    char types where necessary.
  - bugfix in 'binary memory write [X]': had incremented (*ptr)++
    instead of *(ptr++).
  - abandoned use of _Objects_Copy_name_string() (API changed in 4.6.99;
    to be compatible, we always use _Objects_Copy_name_raw()).
